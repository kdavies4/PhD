Integration started at T = 0 using integration method DASSL
(DAE multi-step solver (dassl/dasslrt of Petzold modified by Dynasim))
The following error was detected at time: 27978.43330635493

Model error - Modelica.Math.log (cell.caNegative[1, 1].gas.H2O.p) = Modelica.Math.log (-555.738)

Solver will attempt to handle this problem.


... Error message from dymosim
At time T = 2.797845e+004 and stepsize
H = 1.108797e-009 the code had repeated error test failures
on the last attempted step. A singularity in the solution may be
present. (For DAEs: Provide initial values of X and of XD which
are consistent). Integration will be terminated.
