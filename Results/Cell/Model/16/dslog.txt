Integration started at T = 0 using integration method DASSL
(DAE multi-step solver (dassl/dasslrt of Petzold modified by Dynasim))

... Error message from dymosim
At time T = 2.810031e+004 and stepsize
H = 8.660875e-010 the code had repeated error test failures
on the last attempted step. A singularity in the solution may be
present. (For DAEs: Provide initial values of X and of XD which
are consistent). Integration will be terminated.

Integration terminated before reaching "StopTime" at T = 2.81e+004
